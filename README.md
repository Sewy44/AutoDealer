# AutoDealer
 
#Decscription

With this project I am rewriting the Car Dealership project using .Net Core 6. As I build it, I'll use concepts learned over the last year of writing software professionally. This application Allows public users to see featured vehicles and specials, search vehicles by new or used, make, model, year, and a range of prices and years. Users can request contact in general or about specific vehicles.

Employees can log in and have access to different pages depending on role. Sales users can make Purchases. Admin Users can:

add users, makes, models, and specials
edit users and vehicles
delete vehicles and specials
reset passwords
disable and change user roles
run sales and inventory reports
Technologies/concepts used: HTML, C#, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, .Net Core 6, SQL Server, Entity Framework, Unit Testing with xUnit, Dependency Injection, Razor and HTML Helpers.
